# VueJS_IntermediateProject_LearningResources

This **intermediary project** was made in Vue.js while following ***[a course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide)*** made to learn this ***front-end framework*** thoroughly.

## Thanks to this project, I learned several key features including

- **Components** and ***how to use them*** to create a working application
- How to use **data across components** with ***inject/provide*** but also ***event emiting and listening***
- Using **refs to obtain data from the template** and *what difference* it makes when using it **instead of two-way binding like v-model**
- **Teleporting components** to other part of the DOM to *avoid nested components* and to *help accessibility software*
- Defining **Prop Type** and *if they are required*.
